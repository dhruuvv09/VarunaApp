# ✅ **README.md — Varuna App (Health & Water Quality Monitoring System)**

```markdown
# 🌊 Varuna – Health & Water Quality Monitoring System  
A unified Android application designed to monitor **village water quality**, track **public health reports**, manage **alerts**, and spread **educational awareness**.  
Built using **Android (Kotlin), Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage**, and **Material UI**.

---

## 📌 Overview  
Varuna is a community-centric mobile application developed to support rural and semi-urban regions by providing:

- Water quality record-keeping  
- Patient health reporting  
- CSV-based bulk water data uploads  
- Real-time alert broadcasting  
- Educational material distribution  
- Village-wise reporting & analytics  

This system is primarily used by **Health Officers**, **ASHA Workers**, and **General Public**.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✔ Village Management  
- Add new villages (role: HealthReport / AshaWorker)  
- Auto-sorted A–Z village list  
- Village-wise navigation

### ✔ Water Quality Tracking  
- Add manual water test tables  
- Upload CSV water quality datasets  
- Automatic real-time update in Firestore  
- Displays EPA standards and custom parameters

### ✔ Health Reporting System  
Each report stores:  
- Patient name, age, gender  
- Symptoms (multi-select)  
- Water-related disease indicators  
- Severity level  
- Start date of symptoms  
- Water source  
- Additional notes  
- Cured / Not Cured status  

Also includes village-wise analytics:  
- Total patients  
- Active cases  
- Cured cases  

### ✔ Alert System  
Health/Asha workers can publish alerts that instantly appear to all users.  
Examples:  
- Contaminated water warnings  
- Disease outbreaks  
- Important health notices  

### ✔ Education Module  
Upload and distribute learning material:  
- PDFs  
- Images  
- Awareness articles (hygiene, sanitation, disease prevention)  
- Automatically fetched from Firestore in real-time  

General users can only **view**, not upload.
